Now let's search for actual usage of apcach functions:

Let's check these specific files in more detail to understand how they initialize and use apcach:

Read file: src/ui/services/theme/generate-ui-colors.ts
Let me check what other components might use apcach:

Ran tool
Let's check the Selection components since they might be handling colors:

Read file: src/ui/components/Selection.tsx

Read file: src/ui/components/SelectionContent.tsx
Let's check all directories to see if there are other services that might be using apcach:

Based on my analysis of the codebase, here are the components that use apcach functions and how they initialize them:

## 1. ColorAdjustmentSliders.tsx

**Initialization Method**:
- Imports the entire library as a namespace: `import * as apcachLib from 'apcach';`
- Extracts functions inside the component:
  ```typescript
  const { apcach, apcachToCss, crTo, crToFg, maxChroma } = apcachLib;
  ```
- Uses defensive coding with function checks:
  ```typescript
  const hasLibraryFunctions = useRef(
    typeof apcach === 'function' && 
    typeof apcachToCss === 'function' && 
    typeof maxChroma === 'function' &&
    typeof crTo === 'function' &&
    typeof crToFg === 'function'
  );
  ```

**Functions Used**:
- `apcach()` - For color generation with contrast targets
- `apcachToCss()` - For converting apcach colors to CSS formats
- `crTo()` - To create contrast configs based on background colors
- `crToFg()` - To create contrast configs based on foreground colors
- `maxChroma()` - To calculate maximum allowed chroma values

## 2. generate-ui-colors.ts

**Initialization Method**:
- Imports functions directly from the library:
  ```typescript
  import {
    apcach,
    type ApcachColor,
    apcachToCss,
    crTo,
    crToFg,
    maxChroma,
  } from 'apcach';
  ```
- Uses functions directly without additional checks

**Functions Used**:
- `apcach()` - Used in multiple places to generate colors with specific contrast
- `crTo()` - Used to create contrast configs with background color
- `crToFg()` - Used to create contrast configs with foreground color
- `maxChroma()` - Used to calculate maximum chroma values
- `apcachToCss()` - Used to convert colors to hex format

## 3. Selection.tsx and SelectionContent.tsx

**Initialization Method**:
- These components don't directly import apcach
- They use `ColorAdjustmentSliders` and `generateUIColors` which handle the apcach functionality

**Functions Used**:
- None directly, they delegate to components that use apcach

## Key Patterns in Initialization

1. **Two Different Import Styles**:
   - Direct import: `import { apcach, ... } from 'apcach';`
   - Namespace import: `import * as apcachLib from 'apcach';`

2. **Function Extraction Approaches**:
   - At import time (generate-ui-colors.ts)
   - Inside component (ColorAdjustmentSliders.tsx)

3. **Defensive Coding**:
   - Only ColorAdjustmentSliders uses extensive checks
   - generate-ui-colors.ts uses functions directly without checks

4. **Error Handling**:
   - ColorAdjustmentSliders has extensive error handling and fallbacks
   - generate-ui-colors.ts has minimal error handling

5. **Function Usage Patterns**:
   - Both components use similar function composition patterns:
     ```typescript
     // Pattern seen in both components
     apcach(
       crTo(bgColor, targetContrast),
       maxChroma(originalChroma),
       originalHue
     )
     ```

This comparison shows that the more robust initialization approach is used in ColorAdjustmentSliders.tsx, which is also where the error was occurring. The defensive coding practices in this component are appropriate given that it's handling direct user input through sliders.
